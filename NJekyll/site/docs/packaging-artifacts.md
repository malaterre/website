# Packaging artifacts

The **Artifacts** page of project settings tells AppVeyor which files and folders should be uploaded to AppVeyor cloud storage during the build.

The artifact path must be relative to the root of repository. For example, to upload `myproject.dll` assembly from `bin` folder of a project enter:

    myproject\bin\debug\myproject.dll

You can use wildcards and environment variables in the artifact path. Let's say the "configuration" variable contains the current build configuration. Then to upload all assemblies in bin directory:

    myproject\bin\$(configuration)\*.dll

To push the entire `bin` folder as a single zip archive:

    myproject\bin

To push all `*.nupkg` files in the build folder recursively:

    **\*.nupkg

To push all `*.nupkg` files in sub-directory recursively:

    subdir\**\*.nupkg

To configure project artifacts in `appveyor.yml`:

    artifacts:
      - path: test.zip
        name: MyApp

      - path: logs
        name: test logs
        type: zip

> IMPORTANT! If artifact path starts with `*` surround the value into single quotes, for example:

    - path: '*.nupkg'

or

    - path: '**\*.nupkg' # find all NuGet packages recursively

See [appveyor.yml reference](/docs/appveyor-yml) for more details.


## Packaging multiple files in different locations into a single archive

To create a single "zip" artifact with multiple files from different locations you can use `7z` in "after build" script which is already available in `PATH`:

    7z a myapp.zip %APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER%\path\to\bin\*.dll

Specifying absolute path here is required to remove paths from archive. However, if you need to preserve paths in archive use relative paths, like:

    7z a myapp.zip path\to\bin\*.dll

Finally, have only "myapp.zip" pushed to artifacts.

    artifacts:
      - path: myapp.zip
        name: MyApp


## Pushing artifacts from scripts

You can use the following command-line to push file to build artifacts:

    appveyor PushArtifact <file_name>

or using PowerShell:

    Push-AppveyorArtifact <file_name>

For example, to push all NuGet packages from build folder (non-recursive):

    after_build:
      - ps: Get-ChildItem .\*.nupkg | % { Push-AppveyorArtifact $_.FullName -FileName $_.Name }

The following command pushes the contents of `app.publish` folder preserving directories structure:

    ps: $root = Resolve-Path .\MyApp\bin\Debug\app.publish; [IO.Directory]::GetFiles($root.Path, '*.*', 'AllDirectories') | % { Push-AppveyorArtifact $_ -FileName $_.Substring($root.Path.Length + 1) -DeploymentName to-publish }

See [Pushing artifacts from scripts](/docs/build-worker-api#push-artifact) for more details.

## Getting information about uploaded artifacts

After all artifacts uploaded and *before* starting deployment AppVeyor adds into PowerShell context `$artifacts` hash table with all artifacts. The key of this hash table is artifact *deployment name* and value is the object with the following fields:

* `name` - artifact deployment name. GUID if was not specified;
* `type` - artifact type;
* `path` - local artifact path;
* `url` - temporary download URL which is valid for 10 minutes.

You can iterate through all elements of `$artifacts` hash table with the following code:

	foreach($artifactName in $artifacts.keys) {
  	  $artifacts[$artifactName]
	}
